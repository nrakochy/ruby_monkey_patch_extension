#Monkey Patch Module
Searches an array of hashes for a matching key-value.

* Takes one hash object as argument, with as many key-values as desired
* Converts the passed values to Regex, so it handles partial search queries

## Tests
Specs are included in the file. Enter `ruby arr_helper_module.rb` to run from the command line.
